# Boids - WWDC2020 Student Challenge submission
This playground is my submission to the Apple [WWDC2020 Student Challenge](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/swift-student-challenge/). It contains a simulation with cute little fish that explains swarm/emergent behavior! You can download it under releases.

You can find a demo [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/dcuUWqUO91w).

This playground has been awarded a [WWDC Scholarship](https://www.wwdcscholars.com/s/80F6E34D-8C41-4A41-9493-66E022C535EC).
