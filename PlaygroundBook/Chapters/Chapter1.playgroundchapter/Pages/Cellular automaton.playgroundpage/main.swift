/*:
 Large swarms of fish or birds are complex entities that are comprised of hundreds if not thousands of individuals.
 Each of these is following a set of behavioral rules. One might think that such a rule could be to try and follow a leading bird.
 For small swarms, this might actually be the case but for larger ones, it is quite the opposite.

 Turn your attention to human behavior in a group for a moment.
 Picture a concert hall where everybody wants to leave after the show. Every human has the same goal - to reach the exit. However most of the time not everybody is just going straight for the exit but instead, move laterally to get into a better spot within the group that is trying to leave.
 Another example is people at the checkout in the grocery store. Not everybody is using the same checkout terminal but instead, they are distributing to wherever the least people are at that moment.

 These are some basic examples of rules in the real world and just like humans, fish, and birds have similar rules that determine their behavior.

 You might have noticed the fish on the right. These are currently following one simple rule:

 `move in a random direction`

/*:
 A simulation where you have a lot of individual entities that each follow a set of rules is called a cellular automaton. These are used in areas like biology and physics amongst others to recreate real-world behaviors of complex systems and this playground will make use of it to show you how awesome swarms are!

 The fish on the right will be your pets! You can interact with them by touching them üê†
