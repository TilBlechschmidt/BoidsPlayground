/*:
 Large swarms of fish or birds are complex entities that are comprised of hundreds if not thousands of individuals.
 Each of these is following a set of behavioral rules.

 A simulation where you have a lot of individual entities that each follow a set of rules is called a cellular automaton. These are used in areas like biology and physics amongst others to recreate real-world behaviors of complex systems and this playground will make use of it to show you how awesome swarms are!  You might have noticed the fish on the right. These are currently following one simple rule:

 `move in a random direction`

 They will be your pets! Take care of them, you can interact by touching them üê†
